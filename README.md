# Classes
A datapack for an RPG classes system in Minecraft.

## !! Important Note!!
This datapack is under heavy construction, and only the framework is being developed at this time. It is only being developed under Minecraft 1.17+, as it relies heavily on the /item command, which was only added in 1.17!

This is also my first foray into GitHub, so I'm using this as my chance to experiment and get used to the workflows!
