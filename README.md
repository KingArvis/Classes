# Classes
A datapack for an RPG classes system in Minecraft.

## !! Important Note !!
This datapack is under heavy construction, and only the framework is being developed at this time. It is only being developed under Minecraft 1.18+. Backporting will NOT happen at this time (I'm one person).

**The current build is *playable*, but it's just the Mage, Healer, and Ranger at this time. Ranger is still missing passive bonuses to animals.

This is also my first foray into GitHub, so I'm using this as my chance to experiment and get used to the workflows!


## Planned Classes:
* *(Scope and actual Class perks are subject to change at any time during development!):*

**Mage:**

The mage commands the elements of earth, air, fire, and water. Using their magic, they are able to will the elements to do their bidding and do massive damage to enemies or give buffs to themselves. They have a lower attack speed and attack damage. Due to needing freedom to cast spell, they are unable to wear armor (though they have spells to replicate it!).


**Healer:**

A potent user in healing magic, the Healer is able to heal allies, deal heavy damage to the undead, and grant wide area buffs to surrounding players. The Healer focuses on keeping those around them supported and alive.


**Knight:**

A warrior inside and out, the Knight has powerful attacks and a natural resistance to damage.


**Miner:** (Coming in v1.1)

The Miner gets passive bonuses to a variety of things. The deeper they dig, the tougher they are. Their innate sense of mining bestows them the ability to get more ores from deposits than traditional miners.


**Ranger:**

The Ranger naturally grants tamed animals around them passive bonuses to health and damage resistance. Any beneficial potion a Ranger drinks, confers the benefit to surrounding tamed animals. They are also able to salvage arrows in the ground.
