# Classes
A datapack for an RPG classes system in Minecraft.

## !! Important Note !!
This datapack is under heavy construction, and only the framework is being developed at this time. It is only being developed under Minecraft 1.17+, as it relies heavily on the /item command, which was only added in 1.17!

**The current build is *playable*, but it's just the Mage at this time, and item crafting is non-existant.

This is also my first foray into GitHub, so I'm using this as my chance to experiment and get used to the workflows!


## Planned Classes:
* *(Scope and actual Class perks are subject to change at any time during development!):*

**Mage:**

The mage commands the elements of earth, air, fire, and water. Using their magic, they are able to will the elements to do their bidding and do massive damage to enemies or give buffs to themselves. They have a lower health pool and attack damage, and are unable to wear anything heavier than leather armor (though they have spells to increase their defense!).


**Healer:**

A potent user in healing magic, the Healer is able to heal allies, fight the undead, and grant wide area buffs to surrounding players. The Healer focuses on keeping those around them alive.


**Knight:**

A warrior inside and out, the Knight has powerful attacks and a natural resistance to damage.


**Defender:**

A tanky character with more health, who gains extra benefits when shielding, and when around more players.


**Miner:**

The Miner gets passive bonuses to a variety of things. The deeper they dig, the tougher they are. Their innate sense of mining bestows them the ability to get more ores from deposits than traditional miners.


**Beastmaster:**
The Beastmaster naturally grants friendly mobs around them passive bonuses to health and damage resistance. Any beneficial potion a Beastmaster drinks, confers the benefit to surrounding friendly animals.
