# Classes
A datapack for an RPG classes system in Minecraft.

## !! Important Note !!
This datapack is under heavy construction, and only the framework is being developed at this time. It is only being developed under Minecraft 1.17+. Backporting will NOT happen at this time (I'm one person).

**The current build is *playable*, but it's just the Mage and Healer at this time, and item crafting is a work in progress.

This is also my first foray into GitHub, so I'm using this as my chance to experiment and get used to the workflows!


## Planned Classes:
* *(Scope and actual Class perks are subject to change at any time during development!):*

**Mage:**

The mage commands the elements of earth, air, fire, and water. Using their magic, they are able to will the elements to do their bidding and do massive damage to enemies or give buffs to themselves. They have a lower attack speed and attack damage, and are unable to wear anything heavier than leather armor (though they have spells to increase their defense!).


**Healer:**

A potent user in healing magic, the Healer is able to heal allies, deal heavy damage to the undead, and grant wide area buffs to surrounding players. The Healer focuses on keeping those around them supported and alive.


**Knight:**

A warrior inside and out, the Knight has powerful attacks and a natural resistance to damage.


**Miner:**

The Miner gets passive bonuses to a variety of things. The deeper they dig, the tougher they are. Their innate sense of mining bestows them the ability to get more ores from deposits than traditional miners.


**Ranger:**

The Ranger naturally grants tamed animals around them passive bonuses to health and damage resistance. Any beneficial potion a Ranger drinks, confers the benefit to surrounding tamed animals. They are also able to salvage arrows in the ground.
