# Classes
A datapack for an RPG classes system in Minecraft.

## !! Important Note !!
This datapack is under heavy construction, and only the framework is being developed at this time.

It is only being developed under Minecraft 1.18+. **Backporting will NOT happen, ever**. A lot of the functions used are only available in current versions, and I'll continue to add more features as Mojang adds even more. When that happens, *legacy versions will be unsupported*.

**The current build is *playable*, but it's being *actively* worked on, so expect bugs.

This is also my first foray into GitHub, so I'm using this as my chance to experiment and get used to the workflows!


## Planned Classes:
* *(Scope and actual Class perks are subject to change at any time during development!):*

**Mage:**

The mage commands the elements of earth, air, fire, and water. Using their magic, they are able to will the elements to do their bidding and do massive damage to enemies or give buffs to themselves. They have a lower attack speed and attack damage. Due to needing freedom to cast spell, they are unable to wear armor (though they have spells to replicate it!).


**Healer:**

A potent user in healing magic, the Healer is able to heal allies, deal heavy damage to the undead, and grant wide area buffs to surrounding players. The Healer focuses on keeping those around them supported and alive.


**Knight:**

A warrior inside and out, the Knight has powerful attacks and a natural resistance to damage.

Because they are skilled in physical combat, they are able to do more damage with melee weapons and attack faster. They also have natural knockback resistance, preventing them from being pushed around.

Holding up a shield also protects your allies, within 10 blocks, by giving them resistance against damage.

In addition, Illagers fear the noble Knight, and when they are raiding a village, they suffer from slowness and weakness when a Knight is near them. The Knight, enraged, gains strength and speed boosts when around raiding Illagers.


**Ranger:**

The Ranger has an particular affinity with nature. Any wolf they tame or breed gains higher attack, health, and gains natural armor. Any beneficial potion a Ranger drinks, confers the benefit to the wolves they have tamed/bred.

They also channel natures energies around them, allowing them to passively heal nearby animals. This only applies to animals that will follow the Ranger naturally, or that the Ranger can ride.

Rangers can salvage arrows in the ground when crouching, and can pierce multiple enemies with arrows.
