#0.1.2 (2021-07-24)#

**Bug Fixes:**
- Deep Freeze no longer removes the NoAI tag from mobs that had it existing before cast.
- Bed of Coals respects its visual boundary.
- Projectile spells have been adjusted to hopefully feel a bit more accurate.
- Teleport spell that doesn't hit a block no longer makes the sound & particle effect.
- Water Breathing spell now has Witch particles like other spells. Hopefully this makes it more visible.

**Balance Changes:**
- Levitate no longer has infinite slow fall. It lasts a short time after you stop levitating. Now costs 2 Mana to cast.
- Deep Freeze radius significantly reduced (10 blocks to 3), and Mana cost reduced to 5.
- Torch, Water Strike have been adjusted to hit multiple targets.

**Added Features:**
- Block tags to allow projectile spells to go through water.
